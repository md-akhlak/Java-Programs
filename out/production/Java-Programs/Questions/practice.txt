physical data structure 
-> physical data modules describes how the system should be implemented using specific DBMS system.
-> it elaborate the logical data modules 
-> it deals with storage, indexing, and performance optimization.

Logical Data structure
-> it describes how the system should be implemented regardless the DBMS.
-> focuses on data structure relationships and modules.

asymptotic notation
-> asymptotic notation describes the performance or efficiency of the algorithm
-> it provides a way to analyze the behavior of the algorithm.
-> the commonly used asymptotic notation are :- Big O, Big Omega, Big Theta;
